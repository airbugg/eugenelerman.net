Mona was quietly pacing the dark room. Tonight, like previous nights, was uneventful. She felt her cheeks burn. She couldn’t stand the sight of the lump on the bed, and she couldn’t bring herself to stir the lump awake. She exited the room.

In the little kitchen, beside a tiny table, she tried to make herself as invisible as she possibly could. Her back was itching. She tried to make sense of things.
She heard moans in her head, but whose? Surely not hers. And yet the beckoned her, taunting and moist. Whose head was she tuned into? Not her own, she hasn’t moaned in weeks, months. She felt like a dead cocoon, trapped halfway between… between what? How did she end up here, a shadow on the kitchen wall. She felt like a shadow, too.

“I should tell him,” she caught herself thinking. “Yes, he’d know what to do, he will help once I explain, he will understand.”
But the thought slipped and fell from her as quickly as it came. “Darkness,” she figured, “is all he understands.”

There was a time when the lump and her had made love, had made promises and little incantations to one another. Where do broken promises end up, she wondered.
“Am I a broken promise?”

She stood. Paced towards the small kitchen window and tried to make sense of the world outside. When she first moved to Berlin she saw a sign that made her smile: “The wall was erect only in our minds, for now the wall is torn and we think of it no longer.”
It wasn’t really a sign - more like artful, cursive graffiti, painted on the west side of the crumbling wall. She was encouraged by the sign, though she couldn’t say why. She guessed it filled her with hope, she guessed she made the right choice.

But choices are funny that way she mused, staring out the window. You think a choice closes a door, opens another. But choices, she realized, opened and closed only doors on the inside. She felt lost inside the mausoleum of her soul. She had closed too many doors, and the windows were too small to climb through. Besides, who knew what horrors lingered on the outside. Not her. She became a shadow again, sat quietly and listened to her back itch.

She remembered a camping trip with a former lover. Ill-prepared, poorly dressed for the outdoors. If she knew anything, it was that he didn’t know shit. Barely erected a tent, couldn’t start the fire. It was nice, though. She felt warmth inside her stomach as she thought of that night in the dessert. The Salt factory lights. The artificial silence on their way back, the genuine silence of the night. He told her he loved her, and she clambered onto him and rode him and moaned because she didn’t know what else to do. He sensed she was faking. She felt a fight brewing, so she made up a story instead. It is so much easier to be damaged than to be honest, she thought presently. She wept, silently, just a shadow, on a kitchen wall, in a flat in Berlin.
She recalled a line for a David Bowie song, “Cried so much his face was wet, Then I knew he was not lying..” and sobbed.

Which came before, sin or suffering? She knew she was suffering, and she knew she had sinned. Did one really cause the other?
She dared not think it, but on the tip of her tongue a question formed.
“What now?”

The room was dark, the lump unmoving. If he had died, during her time as a shadow, she couldn’t forgive herself. Panic grabbed her by her itching back and threw her onto him.
She stepped closer, gently peeling the covers from her sleeping lump. Deep, slow breaths. She relaxed a bit, though not entirely. Heart still pounding, she laid beside the figure under the covers.
“Two years and I’m afraid to touch him.” she thought.
“Two years, and I’m afraid to touch myself.”

She woke, though she could swear she was awake already. The room was still dark, she was still in bed. Nothing had changed. Nothing ever changes, but that’s not true, is it? No, things change plenty. Things can get fucked in an instant. Things, such as that fucking wall, had a tendency to stand tall and errect, immovable, constant, up until the moment they didn’t. She wondered if she was the same. Was she that wall, with that graffiti? It bothered her now, and she couldn’t lie still. She turned towards the figure, gently running her hand just below the figure’s nose. She felt the slow, warm exhalation on her finger. She licked it. Someone was moaning in her head again, but it couldn’t possibly be her. She got up, slowly, carefully, and slid out of the room again.

If she was that wall, if she really was that wall, was she a relic? Was she simply too expensive to bring down? was she a monument, and if so - a monument to what? And for what, really. She couldn’t tell. She thought of all the books she’s read, and all the heroes therein. She couldn’t recall a single one.

She laid herself on the floor, cold against her itching back, and ran fingers up and down her belly. Would it help? But then she stopped herself, for an empty mind is so much more lonely than a crowded one. She stood, and cried, and then cried some more.

 “Would this night last forever,” she wondered. “Can I survive another, if I make it through tonight?”, but no answer came, only moans and the itching. That wretched itching, that trusted companion, wherever ache and sorrow dwelled, so did it. It started.. A while ago, she couldn’t exactly recall. It started in Germany, though she has so few memories prior to Berlin or Munich. It could have been with her for the entirety of her existence. And what is to be done about that, anyway? And who is to blame, and to whom can she reach out?
The itching had turned to pain, now. Unignorable, unrelenting. Unforgiving. Even the moans stopped. She could barely think. It soon enveloped her completely, as she curled into a fetus on the floor, and softly writhed.

Minutes passed, though reality remained unchanged. The pain. She imagined two knives being thrust through her breastplate. She felt the icy steel glide through her chest, her lungs, unhurriedly, towards her back. She could not do a thing, she had no air with which to scream or sob, and whatever little vitality she had left was quickly deserting her body. She writhed on the floor, barely breathing, eyes watery and bloodshot. She had resolved to die. But the pain did not subside, nor did it relent. She began to see spots, then colors, then darkness. She was blind, but the pain persisted. She thought of knives and guns, saw her mutilated body as if from above, saw herself in a shallow bath of her own blood on the white linoleum. Her gown, her underwear, her socks - all soaked and crimson. She prayed for release, begged for the pain to stop, begged for her death. The pain did not stop, the pain did not heed her request. It seemed she was destined to writhe on the floor, bleeding from god knows where, for all eternity. Like Atlas, the pain felt like the weight of an entire world, mercilessly driven through her body. She felt crucified, but by whom, and to what end? She wanted to cry but she could barely breathe now, every moment a struggle, every breath drove the invisible blades deeper in. She felt blood welling up inside her mouth, but she could not bring herself to  cough it out. She felt it oozing from her nose and mouth, trailing on the floor, as she desperately tried to do something, anything. The kitchen, that’s where she was. She could try and crawl towards the lump in the bedroom. She can try to wake her partner up, the same partner that wouldn’t touch her for weeks, for months. She tried to crawl towards the bedroom, and the pain surged through her body like a train. She tried to scream. She tried to black out. She was ready to die.

Minutes, hours passed. She found herself reaching for the far wall of the kitchen. The pain was unbearable, her vision reduced to a dark tunnel, with a dim light at the end. She crawled toward it, on her knees or on her stomach, she could not tell. Her back was on fire, her lungs failed her, but the dim light grew closer. And closer still, though not nearly as fast as she had hoped for. Release, silence, is all she wished for, but it looked like she was going to have to fight for that as well. The dim light at the end of her small, black tunnel, beckoned her. She finally knew what it was, it was death, and for whatever reason it was still elusive, still just out of reach. She needed to get even closer, she had to suffer through the pain to let it end. And so she did, by hook or by crook, on her hands and knees, or perhaps on her belly, like a snake, she slithered towards the light with whatever force she could muster. It was death. She wanted nothing more. Never in her life, in her career or her relationships, had she wanted something as deeply and completely as she now wanted death. The dim light, the little tiny switch. Just reach it, then flip it, then silence. “Please, please just let it end,” she hallucinated herself saying, or thinking.
