Jordan: the documentary captures the essence of what Peterson is about, what he stands for, and what our society is willing (and able) to try to do to men like these. The thing that keeps bringing me back to Jordan's work is his emphasis on improving yourself before trying to tackle the world. and in his tackling, you can clearly see how truth, morality and integrity can and DO withstand in the face of cowardice, malice and evil.

Here's a question: Can you be a feminist without thinking there's something inherently wrong with men, society or culture? Sure - just believe in the individual.

I have been somewhat versed in the teachings of Dr. Peterson. This interview, better than any other conversation, lecture or even his book - 12 rules for life - showed me a glimpse of what real masculinity looks like. Distraught by terrible family circumstances, Jordan still agreed to participate in a full hour interview, in which you can palpably feel his emotional torment and hear the strain in his voice. It was difficult to watch. An every day human-being that strove, and still does, to be better.

The title says it all, basically, but here's my take: Here is a man who is (rightfully) proud of his past successes, fearlessly marching forward with new, somewhat radical, but mostly compelling ideas about the nature of reality and computation. Better than String Theory physics, in my opinion.

If there ever was a scientific, moral, spiritual super duo, it'd be Bret and Eric Weinstein. Both are relentlessly curious, morally grounded individuals. Both strive to make meaningful difference. This is a particularly painful episode, because at a certain point Eric seems to completely bully his younger brother Bret. Dear reader, I urge you to persevere. All becomes clear by the end of this podcast, and if your mind isn't blown, it was never there in the first place. Everything is illuminated, in the words of Jonathan Safran.
