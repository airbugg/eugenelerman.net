### ELEW (Eric Lewis): A Career Made One Move at a Time
<!-- [https://youtu.be/yLfq17MLPwc](https://youtu.be/yLfq17MLPwc) -->
{{< youtube yLfq17MLPwc >}}

Eric Lewis' career has circulated both in and out of what he calls "the jazz republic." Performing under his given name in the 1990s, he was a powerful up-and-coming pianist who toured in the bands of Wynton Marsalis and Elvin Jones. As his career progressed -- or failed to, from a business perspective -- he found that a lot of contemporary rock music also spoke to him deeply. So performing under the name ELEW, he devised a new theatrical, high-energy method of solo piano he called rockjazz, and his cover songs took him to TED Conferences, national tours, America's Got Talent, celebrity gatherings and the White House. But he never left the late-night straight-ahead jam sessions: In fact, he's just recorded And To The Republic, a return to the jazz trio format featuring some major players.

Here's a question: Can you be a feminist without thinking there's something inherently wrong with men, society or culture? Sure - just believe in the individual.

### Stephen Wolfram: Cellular Automata, Computation, and Physics | AI Podcast #89 with Lex Fridman
<!-- [https://youtu.be/ez773teNFYA](https://youtu.be/ez773teNFYA) -->
{{< youtube ez773teNFYA >}}

The title says it all, basically, but here's my take: Here is a man who is (rightfully) proud of his past successes, fearlessly marching forward with new, somewhat radical, but mostly compelling ideas about the nature of reality and computation. Better than String Theory physics, in my opinion.

### Bret Weinstein on "The Portal" (w/ host Eric Weinstein), Ep. #019 - The Prediction and the DISC.

If there ever was a scientific, moral, spiritual super duo, it'd be Bret and Eric Weinstein. Both are relentlessly curious, morally grounded individuals. Both strive to make meaningful difference. This is a particularly painful episode, because at a certain point Eric seems to completely bully his younger brother Bret. Dear reader, I urge you to persevere. All becomes clear by the end of this podcast, and if your mind isn't blown, it was never there in the first place. Everything is illuminated, in the words of Jonathan Safran.
