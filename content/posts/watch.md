{{< youtube yLfq17MLPwc >}}
> Eric Lewis is an open portal, a wonderful friend and one of the most important pianists in the world by our measure. As such, we will not bother with further notes for this episode. 
> If you love the quest of the show as well as authentic soulful music, this is your guy.

### Anna Khachiyan, Ep. #017 of The Portal (with Eric Weinstein) - Reconstructing The Mystical Feminine.

Here's a question: Can you be a feminist without thinking there's something inherently wrong with men, society or culture? Sure - just believe in the individual.

### Stephen Wolfram: Cellular Automata, Computation, and Physics | AI Podcast #89 with Lex Fridman
<!-- [https://youtu.be/ez773teNFYA](https://youtu.be/ez773teNFYA) -->
{{< youtube ez773teNFYA >}}

The title says it all, basically, but here's my take: Here is a man who is (rightfully) proud of his past successes, fearlessly marching forward with new, somewhat radical, but mostly compelling ideas about the nature of reality and computation. Better than String Theory physics, in my opinion.

### Bret Weinstein on "The Portal" (w/ host Eric Weinstein), Ep. #019 - The Prediction and the DISC.

If there ever was a scientific, moral, spiritual super duo, it'd be Bret and Eric Weinstein. Both are relentlessly curious, morally grounded individuals. Both strive to make meaningful difference. This is a particularly painful episode, because at a certain point Eric seems to completely bully his younger brother Bret. Dear reader, I urge you to persevere. All becomes clear by the end of this podcast, and if your mind isn't blown, it was never there in the first place. Everything is illuminated, in the words of Jonathan Safran.

I am hopeful this lecture (first of a series) expands your mind, as it did mine, dear reader
