#### [Lulu Miller - Why Fish Don't Exist](https://www.audible.com/pd/Why-Fish-Dont-Exist-Audiobook/179710604X)
> “You don't matter seems to fuel his every step, his every bite. So live as you please. He spent years riding a motorbike, drinks copious amounts of beer, and enters the water, whenever possible, with the belliest of flops. He seems to permit himself just one lie to constrain his otherwise voracious hedonism, to form a kind of moral code. While other people don't matter, either, treat them like they do.”

#### [Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn - The Gulag Archipelago](https://www.amazon.com/The-Gulag-Archipelago/dp/B07PQY9PVL)
> “The line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either – but right through every human heart…even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained. And even in the best of all hearts, there remains…an uprooted small corner of evil.”

> “Don't you have a religion?" Dorolow asked Horza.
>
> "Yes," he replied, not taking his eyes away from the screen on the wall above the end of the main mess-room table. "My survival."
>
> "So... your religion dies with you. How sad," Dorolow said, looking back from Horza to the screen. 
> 
> The Changer let the remark pass.

> The truth is that, to many people calling themselves Socialists, revolution does not mean a movement of the masses with which they hope to associate themselves; it means a set of reforms which 'we', the clever ones, are going to impose upon 'them', the Lower Orders. On the other hand, it would be a mistake to regard the book-trained Socialist as a bloodless creature entirely incapable of emotion. Though seldom giving much evidence of affection for the exploited, he is perfectly capable of displaying hatred—a sort of queer, theoretical, in vacuo hatred—against the exploiters.
