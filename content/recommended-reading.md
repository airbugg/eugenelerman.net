#### [Lulu Miller - Why Fish Don't Exist](https://www.audible.com/pd/Why-Fish-Dont-Exist-Audiobook/179710604X)
> “You don't matter seems to fuel his every step, his every bite. So live as you please. He spent years riding a motorbike, drinks copious amounts of beer, and enters the water, whenever possible, with the belliest of flops. He seems to permit himself just one lie to constrain his otherwise voracious hedonism, to form a kind of moral code. While other people don't matter, either, treat them like they do.”

#### [Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn - The Gulag Archipelago](https://www.amazon.com/The-Gulag-Archipelago/dp/B07PQY9PVL)
> “The line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either – but right through every human heart…even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained. And even in the best of all hearts, there remains…an uprooted small corner of evil.”


#### [Charles Stross - Accelerando](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerando-Singularity-Charles-Stross/dp/0441014151)
> “Humans: such a brilliant model of emotional self-awareness," Aineko says with a theatrical sigh. "You're as stupid as it's possible for an intelligent species to be - there being no evolutionary pressure to be any smarter - but you still don't internalize that and act accordingly around your superiors. Listen, girl, everything you remember is true. That doesn't mean you remember it because it actually happened, just that you remember it because you experienced it internally. Your memories of experiences are accurate, but your emotional responses to those experiences were manipulated. Get it? One ape's hallucination is another ape's religious experience, it just depends on which one's god module is overactive at the time. That goes for all of you." Aineko looks around at them in mild contempt. "But I don't need you anymore, and if you do this one thing for me, you're going to be free. Understand? Say yes, Manfred; if you leave your mouth open like that, a bird will nest on your tongue.”

#### [Robert M. Pirsig  - Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](https://www.amazon.com/Zen-Art-Motorcycle-Maintenance-Inquiry/dp/0060589469)
> “If someone's ungrateful and you tell him he's ungrateful, okay, you've called him a name. You haven't solved anything.”

#### [Michel Houellebecq - Serotonin](https://www.amazon.com/Serotonin-Novel-Michel-Houellebecq/dp/0374261024) 
> "God takes care of us; he thinks of us every minute, and he gives us instructions that are sometimes very precise. Those surges of love that flow into our chests and take our breath away -- those illuminations, those ecstasies, inexplicable if we consider our biological nature, our status as simple primates-- are extremely clear signs.

And today I understand Christ's point of view and his repeated horror at the hardening of people's hearts: all of these things are signs, and they don't realise it. Must I really, on top of everything else, give my life for these wretches? Do I really have to be explicit on that point?

Apparently so."

#### [Ian M. Banks - The Algebraist](https://www.amazon.com/The-Algebraist/dp/B076MHMRMH/) 
> “You judged your own attractiveness - physically, psychologically and in terms of status - then you knew your level and could either raise or lower your sights accordingly, risking rejection but with the possibility of advancement, or settling for a more reliably stable life but never knowing what you might have achieved.”

#### [Ian M. Banks - Consider Phlebas](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8935689-consider-phlebas) 
> “Don't you have a religion?" Dorolow asked Horza.
>
> "Yes," he replied, not taking his eyes away from the screen on the wall above the end of the main mess-room table. "My survival."
>
> "So... your religion dies with you. How sad," Dorolow said, looking back from Horza to the screen.

#### [Alfred Bester - The Stars My Destination](https://www.amazon.com/Stars-My-Destination-Alfred-Bester/dp/1876963468)
> "This was a Golden Age, a time of high adventure, rich living and hard dying... but nobody thought so. This was a future of fortune and theft, pillage and rapine, culture and vice... but nobody admitted it. This was an age of extremes, a fascinating century of freaks... but nobody loved it."

#### [Alfred Bester - The Demolished Man](https://www.amazon.com/Demolished-Man-Alfred-Bester/dp/1596879882)
> "Be grateful that you only see the outward man. Be grateful that you never see the passions, the hatreds, the jealousies, the malice, the sicknesses... Be grateful you rarely see the frightening truth in people."

#### [George Orwell - The Road to Wigan Pier](https://www.amazon.com/Road-Wigan-Pier-George-Orwell-ebook/dp/B004H1UECM)
> The truth is that, to many people calling themselves Socialists, revolution does not mean a movement of the masses with which they hope to associate themselves; it means a set of reforms which 'we', the clever ones, are going to impose upon 'them', the Lower Orders. On the other hand, it would be a mistake to regard the book-trained Socialist as a bloodless creature entirely incapable of emotion. Though seldom giving much evidence of affection for the exploited, he is perfectly capable of displaying hatred—a sort of queer, theoretical, in vacuo hatred—against the exploiters.
